**Give any AI agent full access to your Lofty (formerly Chime) CRM via natural language.**

> "Find all leads in the Active stage assigned to John and send them an SMS follow-up"  
> "Create a task for lead 12345 to call back tomorrow at 9am"  
> "Show me all transactions over $500k that closed this quarter"

120 tools across 22 modules — full coverage of the Lofty API.

## What is this?

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that wraps the Lofty (formerly Chime) CRM API. Connect it to Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible AI client and your agent can read and write your entire Lofty account using plain English.

**Example prompts:**

- "List all leads tagged 'Hot Buyer' who haven't had activity in the last 7 days"
- "Create a call task for lead 9876 assigned to agent Sarah, due in 2 hours"
- "Send an SMS to lead 1234: 'Hi, just checking in — are you still looking?'"
- "Add a note to lead 5678: 'Interested in 3BR, budget $650k, preapproved'"
- "Get all transactions for lead 1234 and show me the property addresses"

## Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js 18+

```bash
node --version  # must be v18.0.0 or higher
```

### 2. Lofty API Key or OAuth Token

Lofty supports two authentication methods — both go in the same `LOFTY_API_KEY` environment variable as a Bearer token:

**OAuth2 Access Token (recommended for production):**
1. Register your application in the Lofty developer portal
2. Complete the OAuth2 flow to obtain an access token
3. Use the access token as your `LOFTY_API_KEY`

**API Key (for testing/scripts):**
1. Log in to your Lofty account
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys** (or contact Lofty support)
3. Generate and copy your API key

> **Note:** The Lofty v1 legacy API is scheduled for sunset on **August 1, 2026**. The tools in this server target the current v2 API paths where available.

```

### Adding a new tool

1. Find the module file under `src/tools/` for the matching resource (or create a new one).
2. Add a `ToolDef` entry with `name`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `handler`.
3. Export it from the module array and import it in `src/index.ts`.
4. Add a test in `tests/tools/`.
5. Run `npm test` to confirm green.

### Authentication

The Lofty API uses Bearer token authentication. Every request includes:

```
Authorization: Bearer <LOFTY_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

Both OAuth2 access tokens and static API keys use the same header format.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `LOFTY_API_KEY is not set` | Missing env var | Add `LOFTY_API_KEY` to your MCP config env block |
| `LOFTY_API_KEY is set to a placeholder` | Left the default value | Replace with your real Lofty bearer token |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired token | Re-generate your API key or refresh your OAuth access token |
| `403 Forbidden` | Insufficient permissions for this endpoint | Check your account permissions or use an admin token |
| Tool not found | Safe mode is on | Set `LOFTY_SAFE_MODE=false` or use a non-delete tool |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Lofty rate limit hit | Built-in retry with backoff — reduce request frequency if persistent |
| Server not showing in Claude Desktop | Config file syntax error or wrong path | Validate JSON, check file path for your OS |
